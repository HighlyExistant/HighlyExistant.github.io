        <h2 class="title"><b>My thoughts on missing out</b></h2>
        <p>
            The feeling of missing out on something you know you wouldn't have liked in the
            first place is a wierd feeling, I wish there was a word for this, since fomo doesn't 
            quite capture it. Fomo implies the reason I am afraid of missing out, 
            is because I want to have fun, but what I feel is that, by entering the activity I 
            would not have fun. What I am feeling is jealosy. Why can someone derive joy from 
            dancing, jumping and singing and I can not. Why does the same shrill of joy screeching 
            from the audience eminate into my eardrums as stressful white noise. I am ripe with 
            jealousy that I can not enjoy the things so many people enjoy, and that I try so hard 
            to enjoy them and fail.

            A wave of self pity overtakes me as I think about the activities I will never enjoy with friends. I hate self
            pity, and pity in general. I hate being pitied, and I hate those who pity me, therefore I hate myself. It's in the same
            vein as me saying that I hate hypocrites and people who's words contradict their actions, and yet my words contradict my 
            actions therefore I am a hypocrite, and thus I hate myself. It's a different equation to the same answer, two adjectives 
            in the set of my personality that are equivalent to the set of things I hate.
