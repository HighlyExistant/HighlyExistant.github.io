        <p>
            I'm programmer who loves math and graphics. I love learning new methods of problem solving
            as well as just messing around with whatever I like. Why did I make this random blog site?
            I mainly wanted a place to put what I've learned in a single place. I've gotten most of my
            programming knowledge from internet blogs, so why not add onto the pile of blogs, hopefully
            someone finds my information useful. All that said, I also want to explore different areas
            outside of programming, and give personal thoughts on things I experience on a daily, that
            be my daily stresses or things I write randomly. Do they provide deep and immense meaning?
            not really, but to be fair I don't think they have to, as long as they speak of how I feel.
